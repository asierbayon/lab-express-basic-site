        <h2>About Kilian</h2>
        <p>He considers himself a 360ยบ mountain athlete because he likes the versatility to be able to be in the mountains every day. He likes running, racing in either ski mountaineering or trail running, crossings, climbing summits, chaining peaks...</p>
        <p>Now he lives in Norway with his family where he continues to enjoy the mountains, trying to seek more versatility than excellence always in a light, simple and dynamic way.</p>
        <p>He likes being able to contribute with his experiences to inspire people to get outside and discover the mountains. It should be by respecting nature and being aware that it's our duty to preserve and protect the environment where we live</p>
